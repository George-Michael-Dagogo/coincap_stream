## This project focuses on extracting and analyzing insights from CoinGecko's API, specifically targeting the top 10 trending coins. Through meticulous data transformations, we generate a Pandas DataFrame to facilitate comprehensive analysis. Automation takes precedence with the integration of Apache Airflow, ensuring systematic and scheduled pipeline execution. Additionally, users can engage in dynamic dashboarding for intuitive data exploration. The project extends its scope by incorporating Azure Functions, providing insights into cloud-based automation tools alongside the open-source Airflow. This holistic approach equips practitioners with a versatile skill set for navigating diverse data workflow landscapes, spanning both on-premise and cloud environments.
